# Smart Water Management – H&S Projectwork 2025

<details>
<summary>Project Overview</summary>

A time series analysis and forecasting project focused on helping water supply companies predict water levels across various types of waterbodies. This aims to support sustainable water management decisions based on seasonal and geographical data.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Context & Background</summary>

Waterbodies like aquifers, lakes, rivers, and springs behave differently due to their unique characteristics. The project is based on datasets that simulate real-world monitoring challenges, derived from the Acea Smart Water Prediction challenge.

<details>
<summary>Data Sources</summary>

- Simulated datasets for:
  - Aquifer
  - Lake
  - River
  - Water Spring
- Climate-related data (rainfall, temperature)
- [Kaggle Competition – Acea Water Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/acea-water-prediction)
